# Simon Says Game ðŸŽµðŸŽ®

 https://samirahamadneh.github.io/Simon-Says/

This is a Simon Says game built using jQuery. The game challenges players to remember and replicate an increasingly difficult sequence of button presses. Each round, the game adds a new step to the sequence, testing your memory and reflexes!

How to Play:

- Press any key to begin the game.
- The game will flash a sequence of button presses â€” remember the order!
- Click the buttons in the exact same sequence.
- If you succeed, a new step is added, and the game gets harder!
- If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart to try again.
